#### **ACADEMIC INTEGRITY**

Penn State defines academic integrity as “the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner” ([Senate Policy 49-20Links to an external site.](http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/47-00-48-00-and-49-00-grades/#49-20)).

Dishonesty of any kind will not be tolerated in this course. Dishonesty includes, but is not limited to cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, unauthorized possession of quizzes/exams, submitting another person’s work as your own, reusing work for another course without permission from the instructor, or tampering with grades or the academic work of other students.

According to Penn State policy [G-9: Academic IntegrityLinks to an external site.](https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html), an academic integrity violation is “an intentional, unintentional, or attempted violation of course or assessment policies to gain an academic advantage or to advantage or disadvantage another student academically.” Unless your instructor tells you otherwise, you must complete all course work entirely on your own, using only sources that have been permitted by your instructor, and you may not assist other students with papers, quizzes, exams, or other assessments. If your instructor allows you to use ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person (e.g., from Course Hero or Chegg) or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, you must identify their source. You may not submit false or fabricated information, use the same academic work for credit in multiple courses, or share instructional content. Students with questions about academic integrity should ask their instructor **before submitting work**.

 **Students facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from the affected course** unless they are cleared of wrongdoing (see [G-9: Academic IntegrityLinks to an external site.](https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html)). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean’s List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College.

Unless your instructor tells you otherwise, to avoid plagiarism in this course always include an in-text citation that includes the author(s) last name(s) and the year the source was published at the end of any sentence or after any image that includes words or ideas you found in a source. Always include quoted text within quotation marks, and always include a reference for any source at the end of your paper. Ask your instructor about reference style as needed.

Sometimes students will seek help from other people or online tutoring, quizzing, studying, social media, or information-sharing sites. Unless your instructor tells you otherwise, you must cite any information you use from these sources to avoid plagiarism, even on exams. Using these sources when they are prohibited may also constitute other academic integrity violations.

**Unless your instructor tells you otherwise, you must complete all course work entirely on your own, and you may not help other students with coursework.**

#### **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

Faculty, staff, and students may need to evacuate campus buildings for several reasons (fire or alarm activation, discovery of a suspicious object, etc.). The following points provide guidance on emergency evacuations:

- Be familiar with evacuation maps posted within the building. Know the location of at least two exits and the corresponding evacuation routes from the classroom.
- Exit the building as quickly and calmly as possible using the nearest safe exit if prompted to do so. Do not use any elevators.
- Move to the building’s “Designated Meeting Site”, or another safe location outside the building.
- Do not re-enter the building until you have been instructed to do so by public safety officials. Silencing of alarms does not necessarily mean that the emergency is over.
- You are strongly encouraged to watch the “StaySAFE” video located at [http://StaySAFE.psu.eduLinks to an external site.](http://staysafe.psu.edu/)

Any student who may require assistance when evacuating the building should notify the instructor so that arrangements can be made to ensure their safety during an emergency.

#### **WEB CAM INFORMATION**

This course may require you to have a webcam for class sessions and assessments. Classes and assessments may be conducted using Zoom or other technology selected by your instructor which may use your computer’s webcam or other technologies to communicate, monitor, and/or record classes, class activities, and assessments. Assessments may also be conducted using proctoring software, which may listen to you, monitor your computer screen, view you and your surroundings, and record (including visual and audio recordings) all activity during the proctoring process. Please contact your instructor if you are unable to comply or have any questions or concerns.
