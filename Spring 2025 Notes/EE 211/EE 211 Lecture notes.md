### DC Circuits
1. OHMS Law
	:V=IR
	:V =  voltage (volts)
	:I = Current (amps)
	:R= resistance (ohms)
2. Power (P)
	: P = VI = I$^2$ R = V$^2$/R  (Watts)
3. Conductance (G)
	:G = I/R (mho's)
4. Kirchhoff's Laws
	1. KCL (K's current Law)
		: Sum of current entering a node = the sum of the currents leaving the node
		:![[Pasted image 20250113183024.png]] 
		I$_1$ +I$_2$ = I$_3$ 
	2. KVL (K's voltage law)
		: Sum of voltage drops around closed loop = 0
		:![[Pasted image 20250113183324.png]]
		: V= Vr1 + Vr2 or Vr1 + Vr2 - V = 0
5. Current flows from Higher (+) to lower (-) protentional

when RL is 0 Norton current and where the current is at it's max
#Short Circuit
	:When there is no resistance between two nodes
Open circuit 
	:When there is infinite resistance between two nodes 
#### Dependent Sources
1. VCCS
	1. Voltage controlled current source 
2. CCVS
	1. Current controlled voltage source
3. VCVS
	1.  Voltage controlled voltage source 
4. CCCS
	1. Current controlled current source 
#### Power

1. P<sub>x </sub>= VI = (10V)(5A)
	1. 50 wats : positive: power is absorbed by element 
	2. resistor (+ ---> -)
2. P<sub>x </sub>= VI = (-10V)(5A)
	1. -50 wats: negative: power is being supplied by element 
	2. battery  **(*-********* ---> +)

1. Series: R<sub>total</sub> = R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub>+  R<sub>3</sub> +  R<sub>4</sub>+....
2. Parallel R<sub>total</sub> = $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1}  +\frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}...}$
	1. Notation: R<sub>1</sub> || R<sub>2</sub> >R<sub>1</sub> is parallels to R<sub>2</sub>
