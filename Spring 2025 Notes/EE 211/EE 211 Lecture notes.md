### DC Circuits
1. OHMS Law
	:V=IR
	:V =  voltage (volts)
	:I = Current (amps)
	:R= resistance (ohms)
2. Power (P)
	: P = VI = I$^2$ R = V$^2$/R  (Watts)
3. Conductance (G)
	:G = I/R (mho's)
4. Kirchhoff's Laws
	1. KCL (K's current Law)
		: Sum of current entering a node = the sum of the currents leaving the node
		:![[Pasted image 20250113183024.png]] 
		I$_1$ +I$_2$ = I$_3$ 
	2. KVL (K's voltage law)
		: Sum of voltage drops around closed loop = 0
		:![[Pasted image 20250113183324.png]]
		: V= Vr1 + Vr2 or Vr1 + Vr2 - V = 0
5. Current flows from Higher (+) to lower (-) protentional
