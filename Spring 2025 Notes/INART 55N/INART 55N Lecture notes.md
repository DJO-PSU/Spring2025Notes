- What is Sound?
	- The vibration that propagates as mechanical wave of pressure through air, water, and solids.
	- Passing energy through molecules
	- Frequency (pitch)
		:How fast it is vibrating, number of pressure cycles per second. Measured in Hertz (Hz). Relative highness or lowerness of a sound
		:![[Pasted image 20250114144354.png]]
	- Amplitude (loudness)
		: the Hight of wave 
	- Timbre ( quality, color , tone)
		:Different instruments
		: comes from a collection of Amplitude and frequency making a unqiue sound 
	- Crescendo
		:Gradual increase in loudness 
	- decrescendo 
		: gradual decrease in loudness
### Timbre
always the loudest 
Brighter: Greater energy in high frequencies 
	Violin, trombone
Warm (dark): lesser energy in high frequencies 
	horn, clarinet 
Orchestration: the combination of sounds

Harmonic:
You have one Fundamental note, and a mix of waves that is 1/x the size of the fundamental; where x is a integer. They come together to make the sound
Made of a series of integer multiples
non-harmonic:
non integer multiples

- Elements of Music 
- Melody:
	- succession of notes 
	- Range of notes
		- Narrow ( children's song)
		- Medium ( pop/rock)
		- Wide (Mariah Carrey)
- Contour: General 'shape' of a melody 
	- Ascending, Descending , arch, static 
- Melodic movement 
	- conjunct melodies move by small steps
	- Disjunct melodies move by larger leaps 
- Harmony
	- Simultaeous combination of notes 
	- vertical aspect of music 
- Consonant harmony 
	- Agreeable combination of notes 
	- relaxed, at rest, fulfilled 
- Meter
	- Beats grouped into recurring pattersn
		- underlying time grid in music 
			- constant beats at tempo = 60 to 200 bpm 
			- recurring pattern of accents
		- pop/rock is in group of 4
	- Simple meter:
		- divisions in 2s (march)
	- Compound meter
		- divisions in 3s ( swing)
	- Asymmetrical meter
		- switch between 2s and 3s
	- Syncopation
		- Rythms that fall between beats 
- Textures 
	- Monophonic texture : single melodic voice without accompiment 
	- Heterophonic texture: Melody with a modified varied version of itself ( slopy)
- Homophonic texture: meoldy with accopiment 
- Polyphonic: two or more
Form:
- Structural organization of music o
- repetition and contrast 
	- Binary: two-part form: AB or AABB
	- Ternary: Three part form: ABA or AABA
	- Theme and Variations: A A' A'' A'''
	- Rondo ABACABA
	- Arch ABCDCBA
	- Through Composed: ABCDEFG...
	- Free Form: cohd78eh8iuc98dch9
